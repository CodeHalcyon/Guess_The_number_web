# Guess_The_number_web
This is my small Javascript project, which is about guessing a number that is already selected by the computer. 
The number is from 1 to 100, in order to make a guess select a number from 1 to 100.
The score starts from 100.
Everytime you guess the number your score decreases and the decrement is always compounded. 
If your score reaches zero or less than zero, the game ends.
There is no limitation for the guesses, you can make "n" number of guesses
